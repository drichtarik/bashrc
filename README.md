This is my custom version of his awesome bash configuration

# bashrc
My customized bash shell environment.

# Usage
```
git clone git@github.com:jtulak/bashrc.git ~/.bash
ln -s ~/.bash/bashrc ~/.bashrc
```
Create a `~/.bash/private.rc` file for things like keys and passwords in environment variables, and other stuff that should not get indexed by git.
